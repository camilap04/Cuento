Once upon a time there was a sweet little girl who loved her mother and grandmother very much. She helped them in every way she could and because she was so good, on her birthday her grandmother gave her a red hood. As she liked it so much and went everywhere with it, soon everyone began to call her Little Red Riding Hood.

One day Little Red Riding Hood's grandmother, who lived in the forest, fell ill and Little Red Riding Hood's mother asked her to bring her a basket with a cake and a jar of butter. Little Red Riding Hood gladly accepted.

- Be very careful, Little Red Riding Hood, and don't dawdle in the woods with a lot of rocks and fungus
- Yes, Mother!

The little girl was walking quietly through the forest when the wolf saw her and approached her.

- Where are you going, Little Red Riding Hood?
- To my grandmother's house to bring her this basket with a cake and butter.
- I wanted to see her too.... so why don't we have a race? You go that way over here and I'll go this way.
- Okay!

The wolf sent Little Red Riding Hood down the long way and beat her to Granny's house. So he pretended to be the little girl and knocked on the door. But what he didn't know was that a hunter had seen him arrive.

- Who is it, replied Granny?
- It's me, Little Red Riding Hood," said the wolf.
- How nice, my daughter. Come in, come in

The wolf came in, pounced on Granny and ate her in one bite. He put on his nightgown and got into bed to wait for Little Red Riding Hood to arrive.

The little girl was busy in the forest picking hazelnuts and flowers, so it took her a little longer to arrive. When she arrived, she knocked at the door.

- Who is it," answered the wolf, trying to tune his voice, "it's me, Little Red Riding Hood.
- It's me, Little Red Riding Hood. I've brought you a cake and a jar of butter.
- How nice, my child. Come in, come in.

When Little Red Riding Hood came in, she found Granny different, although she didn't quite know why.

- Granny, what big eyes you have!
- Yes, they are to see you better, my child.
- Granny, what big ears you have!
- Sure, they are to hear you better....
- But grandma, what big teeth you have!
- They are to eat you better!

As soon as she said this, the wolf pounced on Little Red Riding Hood and ate her too. Her stomach was so full that the wolf fell asleep.

At that moment, the hunter who had seen him enter the grandmother's house began to worry. It had been a long time and since it was a wolf... God knew what could have happened! So he went inside the house. When he got there and saw the wolf with a swollen belly, he imagined what had happened, so he took his knife and opened the animal's belly to pull out Little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother.

- We must give this wolf a good punishment, thought the hunter.

So he filled the wolf's belly with stones and sewed it back together. When the wolf woke up from his nap he was very thirsty and as he approached the river, wham! he fell in and drowned.

Little Red Riding Hood saw her mother and grandmother again and from then on she promised to always listen to what her mother told her.
